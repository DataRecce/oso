# How to run OSO (OpenSource Observer) in the GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces is a feature that allows you to develop the repository in the cloud. This is a guide on how to run the Open Source Observer repository in GitHub Codespaces directly.

## Prepare the Data Warehouse of OSO
To run the OSO repository in GitHub Codespaces, you need to prepare the data warehouse of OSO on your own GCP BigQuery. You can also follow the [Get-Stated](https://docs.opensource.observer/docs/get-started/) document on the OSO website to prepare the data warehouse.
